# BBC Sport Responsive Site

## Introduction

> This exercise is for you to practice building responsive layouts.

Your task is to replicate BBC Sport's responsive layout. [Look at the website here](www.bbc.com/sport) and play with the width of the window to see what you need to do.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided and replicate the BBC Sport website's responsive layout.
* You may attempt to use Bulma to help you create the layout, but we would recommend only using the columns functionality combined with the responsive modifiers.
* Feel free to use a mix of bulma classes and your own css together. Make sure the link to your personal stylesheet is placed below the bulma cdn!.
* You don't have to do the entire page! See below for the deliverable. Good luck!
