# Basic Express API lab

Your challenge is to build an Express API with INDEX, SHOW and CREATE routes.

## Deliverables

You should submit a  working API allows a user to view all the resources stored in the database.

You can base your API around anything you like, but keep it something simple for now.

## Bonus

Have a go at adding the remaining RESTful routes. You can do them in any order, but we would suggest the following:

1. INDEX
1. SHOW
1. CREATE
1. DELETE
1. UPDATE

## Tips

* Work slowly toward your goal, and test frequently as you go
* Do not copy / paste from code you have written during class, this will not help you understand how everything fits together
* Don't forget to run `yarn init` to start your project as a node project.
* Add one route at a time and test in Insomnia before moving on
